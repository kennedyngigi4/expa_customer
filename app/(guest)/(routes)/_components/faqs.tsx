                        Couriers fill the need for delivery of packages where shipping just doesn’t cut it. Some examples 
                        would be when a delivery needs to be completed quickly or the same day. Others an include when a package 
                        is too large to be shipped but still needs to be delivered quickly. Some deliveries are also too valuable to 
                        leave to a normal shipping provider. A courier and same day delivery service fills those needs because your 
                        package is picked up at point A and driven to point B without any stops in between. This means your package 
                        arrives on time and safely to it’s destination.
